## Basic association testing
### Case/control
- Standard Allelic Test [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4054703/#:~:text=The%20allelic%20test%20is%20an,genotype%20in%20case%2Dcontrol%20studies]
- Fisher's exact test
- Cochran-Armitage trend test
- Mantel-Haenszel and Breslow-Day tests for stratified samples
- Dominant/recessive and general models
- Model comparison tests (e.g. general versus multiplicative)

### Family-based association (TDT, sibship tests)
### Quantitative traits, association and interaction
### Association conditional on one or more SNPs
### Asymptotic and empirical p-values
### Flexible clustered permutation scheme
### Analysis of genotype probability data and fractional allele coounts (post-imputation)
